# 2048 -  The Classic Puzzle Game
Welcome to 2048, a fun and addictive number puzzle game inspired by 1024 and Saming's 2048.

ðŸŽ® About the Game
2048 is a simple yet challenging puzzle game where your goal is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. But be warned, it's not as easy as it sounds!

This project was made just for fun and as a tribute to the original game.
